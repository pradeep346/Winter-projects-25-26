# Natural Language Command & Control for UAVs

## 1. Project Description

This project builds a complete system that allows a user to control a UAV using simple natural language commands. Instead of manually specifying coordinates or using a joystick, the user can give commands like "Fly a 5 meter square and come back" or "Go around the pole". The system processes this input, converts it into structured waypoint trajectories, validates them for safety, and executes them on a simulated drone using ArduPilot SITL.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how high-level human instructions can be translated into precise, deterministic drone movements. It combines concepts from natural language processing, geometry-based trajectory planning, safety validation, and real-time drone control.

---

## 2. Overall System Flow

The entire system works as a pipeline:

User Command → Command Parsing → Waypoint Generation → Safety Validation → Drone Execution (SITL)

Each module plays a specific role in converting human intent into safe and executable drone actions.

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

The system is divided into the following main components:

Command Input  
Command Interpretation (LLM / rule-based parsing)  
Geometry-based Trajectory Generator  
Safety Checker (constraint validation layer)  
Drone Controller (DroneKit interface)  
ArduPilot SITL (simulation environment)  

All modules are integrated together in a single controller script to form a complete working system.

---

## 4. Trajectory Generation (geometry_utils.py)

This module generates mathematical waypoint paths based on the command.

Implemented trajectories:

- Circle → evenly spaced points forming a closed loop  
- Helix → circular motion with increasing altitude  
- Orbit → circle around a fixed point (pole)  
- Scan (Lawnmower pattern) → area coverage path  

Key idea: All trajectories are deterministic and based on simple trigonometry (sin, cos) and geometry.

Example:  
north = center_n + r * cos(theta)  
east = center_e + r * sin(theta)  

This ensures smooth and predictable motion.

## 6. Command Handling (main_controller.py + llm_waypoints.py)

The system interprets user input and maps it to trajectory functions.

Examples:

- "Fly a 5 m square and come back" → square waypoints  
- "Go around the pole" → orbit trajectory  
- "Fly north 10 meters" → linear path  

The commands are converted into structured waypoint dictionaries:

{ "north": value, "east": value, "alt": value }

These waypoints are then passed to the drone controller.

---

## 7. Safety Layer (safety_checker.py)

A critical part of the system is the safety validation layer.

Rules enforced:

- Minimum altitude: ≥ 2 meters  
- Maximum altitude: ≤ 50 meters  
- Maximum range: ≤ 100 meters from home  
- Obstacle avoidance: ≥ 2 meters away  
- Return condition: final waypoint must be near home  

If any rule is violated:

- The mission is rejected  
- A reason is returned  

This ensures that unsafe commands never reach the drone.

---

## 8. Drone Control (DroneKit)

The drone is controlled using DroneKit API.

Key operations:

- Connect to SITL  
- Set mode to GUIDED  
- Arm the drone  
- Takeoff to desired altitude  
- Move through waypoints using simple_goto()  
- Return to launch (RTL)  

The drone follows the generated path step-by-step.

---

## 9. Simulation Environment (SITL)

ArduPilot SITL is used to simulate the drone.

Features:

- Realistic flight behavior  
- GPS simulation  
- MAVLink communication  
- Visual map + console  

This allows testing without real hardware.

Through this project, I learned how high-level natural language commands can be converted into structured control instructions for a UAV. I understood how trajectory generation works using mathematical models and how important safety validation is in real-world systems. Working with DroneKit and ArduPilot helped me understand MAVLink communication and drone control mechanisms. I also gained experience in debugging simulation issues such as GPS delays and connection errors. Overall, this project helped me bridge the gap between AI-based command interpretation and real-time control systems.
